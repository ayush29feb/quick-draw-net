# Quick, Draw! Sketch Classification

This repository follows from my previous project called [Sketch-A-XNORNet](http://github.com/ayush29feb/Sketch-A-XNORNet) which was an implementation of Sketch-A-Net with binary optimizations inspiried from XNOR-Net. I used the [TU-Berlin Sketch Dataset](http://cybertron.cg.tu-berlin.de/eitz/projects/classifysketch/) for Sketch-A-XNORNet.

For this project, I am using the recently released and much larger [Quick, Draw! Dataset](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset) by Google. The dataset is a collection of 50 million drawings across 345 categories, contributed by players of the game [Quick, Draw!](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/)
